# physcomp-example-site-html

A simple example documentation website for the Physical Computing course. Just simple HTML

## Setup

> **_NOTE:_** This guide does not include setting your own cloned repo and using git commands, for that ask Matti or Calvin.

Create or login to a github account [here](https://github.com/login).

Once logged in, create a new repository using the New button.

Then, select **Import a repository**
.
Use this repository address (https://github.com/aaltonewmedia/physcomp-example-site-html) as the old repository URL.

Give a name to your repository, and make sure it is set to public. Then hit **Begin import**.

## Publish the page

Go to **Settings** on your repository page and then to the **Pages** tab.

On the **Branch** section click the drop-down menu that says **None** and select **main**. Then click **Save**

Go back to the repository main page. Your page will be published in around 2-3 minutes.

On the **About** section on the right side of the page, click the gear icon. Then write a brief description (optional) and write down on the website field, your page url. Example: https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name

## Edit your repo

Download the **index.html** file and edit it in VSCode or any code editor. There are instructions within the file. Similarly, you can edit it directly within GitHub.

To upload images, go into the images folder and upload them directly from there. Remember to link them, using the correct iamge name in the **index.html** file.

Everytime you make a change GitHub will ask to "Commit" these changed. Write down a title for your commit and an optional description and hit **Commit changes**.

These changes are updated into your website after a minute or two.

## Edit this README

You can delete all the text here and create your own readme. Also delete the images that came with this repository and upload your own.
